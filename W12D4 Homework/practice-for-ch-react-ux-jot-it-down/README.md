# JotItDown

This exercise will help you practice creating usable, visually pleasing layouts
around existing content.

You will apply the UX concepts you know to create CSS layouts for the
__index.html__ and __splash.html__ pages of a note-taking app. You will need to
reorganize the information, apply relevant markup, and add styling.

Tips:

* Keep visual hierarchy and web layout conventions in mind.
* Don't forget to add signifiers. A _signifier_ is an observable cue that helps
  a user know how to use your app. Examples could include--but are certainly not
  limited to--the shape and color of elements, cursor effects, and hover
  effects.
* If you feel stuck, refer to existing note-taking apps for inspiration.

Begin by cloning the repo at the `Download Project` button below.

## Splash

Edit the __splash.html__ page's HTML and create styles for its elements in
__styles.css__. Your goal is to make it look similar to simple splash pages like
[Evernote's][evernote] or [OneNote's][onenote]. Create and style a nav bar,
style and position the hero image (the large image towards the top of the page),
and add signifiers for users to sign up / sign in / sign out.

## Index

Edit the HTML in `index.html` and create styles for its elements. Your goal is
to create a conventional index page of a note-taking app. You can look to
[Evernote][evernote], [OneNote][onenote], [Asana][asana], and other similar
applications for inspiration.

Organize and wrap the given content in the appropriate HTML elements, then write
styles for each element in __styles.css__. You are allowed to rearrange the
content if you think it would make more sense in a different order; you can also
add content and edit the existing content if you would like more information to
be displayed.

You should create HTML elements and styles for:

* Nav bar
* Footer
* List container
* List Item
* Search Form
* New List Form
* New Item Form

When you're done, compare your work against the real examples included in the
project's __screenshots__ directory.

## Bonus

* Make sure your site meets [web-accessibility standards][standards].
* Implement a color scheme for your site. Your scheme should have 3 colors:
  background, main, and accent. You can get inspiration from [colourlovers].
* Add custom [fonts]. You should have a header font and a body font.
